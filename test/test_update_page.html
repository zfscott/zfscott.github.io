<section style="background: lightyellow">
<p>Happy Pi Day! We have a few announcements.</p>
<hr>

<h4>1 - Modified Shipment Deadline</h4>

<p>
We usually load drives on the 1st of the month– but due to logistics,
we are moving this cycle’s install date forward a few days.
</p>

<p>
<strong>
Please ensure that drive shipments arrive by March 27th.
</strong>
</p>

<p>
As always, our address can be found here:
<a href="/address.txt">https://zfs.rent/address.txt</a>.
</p>
<hr>

<h4>2 - IPv6 Support</h4>

<p>
We are extremely excited to announce IPv6 support! It’s been a long-time coming.
</p>

<p>
Several customers have already trialed the connectivity. No issues have been reported thus far.
</p>

<p>
<strong>
We plan to enable IPv6 routing for all customers on March 21st, 2025.
</strong>
</p>

<p>
Each VM will be assigned a single, routable IPv6 address via SLAAC. Most systems
will not require any configuration changes. Customer subdomains will be
updated to include AAAA records.
</p>

<p>
Please email <a href="mailto:support@zfs.rent">support@zfs.rent</a> if:
<ol>
<li>You <em>do not want</em> IPv6 packets routed to your VM.
<li>You need help adapting a non-standard network configuration.
<li>You want IPv6 enabled immediately. We can toggle it per VM fairly quickly.
<li>You have general feedback or comments. We always enjoy hearing from customers!
</ol>

May your bits never flip :)<br>

  <p>
  Happy December everyone!
  <hr>

  <p>
  Scott and I talked recently, and it's been decided that...<br><br>
  We should <em>probably</em> make a better effort to publish some updates.
  At the very least, expect a short blurb every time we load drives.

  <hr>

  <p>
  Customer drives were installed on December 2nd. No issues there.

  <p>
  Some of our lesser spec'd hypervisors will be decommissioned soon.
  In November, we communicated with a subset of users and migrated
  their VM + drive setups to new equipment. Everything went
  smoothly!

    Just FYI everyone, we are still in business.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are in the middle of revamping the website to include
    long-awaited management features (VNC, reboot, etc.)
    as well as an automatic billing system.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal is to keep it on the down low, until it is polished
    and deployed.

<h4 class="urgent">Migration Complete!</h4>
<p>Okay, I'm confident that the full physical migration has been completed.</p>
<p>It's been a very tiring day, but I will follow-up again this weekend on the software
side of things.</p>
<p>
If anyone has any issues at all, please email me and I will take care of
individual issues one at a time.

Thank you everyone for your patience!

<h4 class="urgent">Migration Update #3</h4>
  <p>
  Received some emails that some customers cannot access their VMs.
  </p>

  <p>
  Appears that some IP + DNS records have not been set correctly.
  </p>

  <p>
  Will be resolved in the next 24 hours. Other than that, everything has
  been stable and customers are on the new IP blocks.

  <p>Okay! Almost done.</p>
  <p>All drives have been loaded into the new hypevisors and have been detected

<p>
All systems and drives were unloaded and safely moved out of the Sac
datacenter.
</p>

<p>
New IP addresses acquired for customers. DNS will be updated soon.
</p>

<p>
Preparing the new hypervisors took longer than expected. They are
almost done. I expect to have them installed by EOD Oct. 7th.
</p>

<p>
Will keep posting updates here. Once the full process is complete,
I will publish a detailed post of some of the new hardware.
</p>

<p>
All users part of the migration will receive a credit as mentioned before.
Once the new systems are installed, I will follow-up on the software +
monitoring roadmap.

<h4 class="urgent">DATACENTER MIGRATION</h4>
<p>
First of all, apologies for the short notice.
</p>

<p>
On <strong>Monday, October 3rd, 2022</strong> we are terminating our
contract with DataNoc (Sacramento).

<p>
DataNOC has consistently had network and power outages during our two-year term.
Hurricane Electric has had zero outages in the 1+ years we have been with them.
</p>

<p><strong>
All Sacramento hypervisors and drives will be migrated to Hurricane Electric
(Fremont) where the bulk of current customers/drives reside.
</strong></p>

<p>
We have about 50 drives in Sacramento that will be moved. All drives will
be transferred in several ESD-safe drive-carrying cases.
</p>

  <img src="img/drive_case_1.jpg" title="20-bay drive case" height="250px" style="float: right">
  <h4 class="urgent">IMPORTANT NOTES</h4>
  <p><ol>

    <li>
      <strong>All systems will back online by Oct. 5th</strong>

      <p>
      Service will be carried on as usual. We have been growing by 3-5
      new customers a month and are incredibly happy to serve our customer
      base.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>We will perform a full inventory of SAC drives</strong>

      <p>
      If you would like to cancel, now is a good time. If this is the case,
      we are open to purchasing your used drives to save on shipping and
      handling. We can also help export your data off the drives via:
      <br>
      <code>dd if=/dev/sda > clone.img</code>
      </p>

      <p>
      If you are on the fence, please read
      <a href="#u7-notice">the section below</a>.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>All customers will be moved to Stripe.</strong>

      <p>
      The billing process will be simplified significantly. Currently,
      we using a mix of Shopify, Xero, and Stripe. After this migration,
      everyone will be on the same platform (Stripe).
      </p>

      <p>
      Instead of pay-as-you-go data transfer, we will add the amount
      transferred to your invoice ($5/TB sent or received). You can set a
      monthly cap at which point your machine will be throttled to 5-10 mbps
      and an email will be sent out.
      </p>

      <p>
      (This minimum mbps may increase in the future, depending on average network load.
      It should be enough for SSH, VNC, basic file transfers, etc.)
      </p>
    </li>

  </ol></p>

  <div class="important" id="u7-notice">
    <b class="urgent">Customers affected by the migration</strong>

    <p>
    We understand that our software development has been frustratingly slow
    and the outages at the Sacramento location have been disappointing.
    </p>

    <p>
    So far, our churn rate has been amazing. We have been in business
    for nearly two years. We have had 91 total customers with 150 unique drives.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>We have only had four customer cancellations to date.</strong>
    </p>
    <hr>

    <p>
    For those affected by this migration or are on the fence about canceling,
    we would greatly appreciate you sticking around as we improve the service
    during the next 30 to 45 days.
    </p>

    <p>
    <strong>I will publish a feature roadmap on GitHub on Tuesday.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    Please feel free to chime in + request features.
    You can also email
    <a href="mailto:support@zfs.rent">support@zfs.rent</a>.

    <strong>We are offering all grandfathered customers:</strong>

    <ul>
      <li style="font-size: 120%">3-months of free service</li>
      <li style="font-size: 120%">1 TB of additional data transfer</li>
